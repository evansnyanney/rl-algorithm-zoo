**RL Algorithm Zoo** contains implementations of four reinforcement learning methods applied to the CartPole-v1 task. The project compares a policy-based method (REINFORCE), a value-based method (DQN), a hybrid method (A2C), and an offline candidate (Decision Transformer).

## Overview

This project compares four RL algorithms on CartPole-v1 using two primary metrics: average return and average episode length (which are equivalent in CartPole, since each timestep gives a reward of 1). The methods examined are:

- **REINFORCE (Policy-Based):** A classic policy-gradient method.
- **DQN (Value-Based):** A deep Q-network for estimating action values.
- **A2C (Hybrid):** An actor-critic approach that combines policy and value learning.
- **Decision Transformer (Candidate):** An offline method that learns from expert demonstrations.

## Key Performance Metrics

The following table summarizes the final evaluation metrics for each algorithm:

| **Algorithm**                   | **Average Return** | **Average Episode Length** |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **REINFORCE (Policy-Based)**    | 500.00             | 500                        |
| **DQN (Value-Based)**           | 9.40               | 9                          |
| **A2C (Hybrid)**                | 9.63               | 9â€“10                       |
| **Decision Transformer (Candidate)** | 10.40        | ~10                        |

*Note: In CartPole-v1 the reward per timestep equals the episode length.*
